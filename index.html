        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Drought and desertification are pressing environmental issues that significantly impact India's
socio-economic fabric, agricultural sustainability, and ecological balance. As a nation characterized
by diverse climates, India faces severe challenges from these phenomena, particularly in arid and
semi-arid regions. The country relies heavily on agriculture, which employs over 60% of its
population and contributes significantly to its GDP. Thus, understanding the intensity of drought
and the status of desertification across various Indian states is crucial for developing effective
interventions and policy measures to mitigate their effects.
<br>
&nbsp;
Desertification, on the other hand, is the degradation of land in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid
areas caused by various factors, including climatic variations and human activities. It is a gradual
process that can transform fertile land into desert-like conditions, threatening agricultural
productivity and biodiversity. Recent studies indicate that approximately 30% of India’s land area
is affected by desertification, with regions such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, and parts of Maharashtra
particularly at risk. The loss of arable land due to desertification not only diminishes food
production but also contributes to rural poverty and displacement, as communities struggle to
adapt to diminishing natural resources.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Research indicates that climate change is intensifying
          the frequency and severity of droughts in India. According to the Indian Meteorological
          Department (IMD), the country has witnessed an increase in extreme weather events,
          including prolonged dry spells and erratic rainfall patterns (IMD, 2021). Studies by Kumar et
          al. (2019) have employed statistical methods to analyze historical rainfall data, revealing a
          trend toward more frequent and severe droughts in specific regions, particularly in central
          and western India.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
           Several studies have documented the socio-economic
consequences of drought. A report by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural
Development (NABARD, 2020) found that drought leads to significant reductions in
agricultural productivity, adversely affecting food security and rural livelihoods. Farmers
often resort to distress selling of assets or migration, leading to long-term socio-economic
instability (Shah, 2018)

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
         
         The use of drought indices such as the Standardized Precipitation Index
          (SPI) and the Drought Severity Index (DSI) has been pivotal in assessing drought intensity.
          Research by Mishra and Singh (2010) emphasizes the importance of these indices for
          quantifying drought conditions and informing water management policies.
