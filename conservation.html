          A. Drought Analysis :- Trends Over Time: The analysis of meteorological data from 1990 to 2020 revealed a
significant increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts across the selected states. For
example, Rajasthan experienced an average of 2.5 severe drought years per decade,
compared to only 1 in the previous decades. Similarly, Gujarat showed a notable increase in
the duration of drought conditions, with some regions experiencing droughts lasting up to 18
months.<br>

          2. Socio-Economic Impact : Agricultural Productivity
        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Interviews with local farmers revealed a direct correlation
between drought events and reduced crop yields. For instance, in Maharashtra, many
farmers reported yield losses of 30-50% for staple crops like wheat and pulses during
drought years. This decline has exacerbated food insecurity and increased the reliance on
government aid.

          Soil Quality Assessment: Field surveys indicated significant soil degradation, characterized
by reduced fertility and increased salinity levels. Soil samples from Rajasthan showed a 15%
decrease in organic matter content, which directly impacts agricultural productivity and
ecosystem health.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          A. Traditional Remediation Practices<br>
(i) Rainwater Harvesting: The study found that traditional practices such as rainwater
harvesting have been successfully implemented in various communities. In Rajasthan, johads
(traditional earthen check dams) have been effective in recharging groundwater and
improving water availability during dry spells. Communities reported a 25-30% increase in
water availability for agriculture following the construction of johads.<br>
(ii) Agroforestry: Integration of trees with agricultural crops was another successful practice
observed. Farmers practicing agroforestry noted improved soil health and increased
biodiversity, which contributed to enhanced resilience against drought.<br>
B. Non-Traditional Remediation Methods<br>
(i) Modern Irrigation Techniques: The adoption of drip irrigation systems in Gujarat has shown
promising results, leading to water savings of up to 50%. Farmers who implemented these
systems reported better crop yields and reduced reliance on groundwater. However, the high
initial costs of installation remain a barrier for widespread adoption.<br>
(ii) Community-Based Approaches: The involvement of local communities in designing and
implementing remediation strategies was critical to their success. Case studies highlighted
the effectiveness of community-led initiatives in restoring degraded lands, as these efforts
leveraged local knowledge and fostered a sense of ownership.<br>
